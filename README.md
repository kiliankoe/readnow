# ðŸ“– readnow

Keep throwing links into your Safari's reading list without ever looking at them again? Want to stop thinking of your reading list as the place where articles go to die?

This simple tool opens a random link from your reading list for you to read. Now.

Keep this up with somewhat of a routine and you'll (hopefully) be able to bring the count of pages in your reading list back down ðŸ––
